Hi. I'm Nash. I work for Sonos. I tinker around with hobby electronics, programming,
 and bluegrass music in my spare time. I think the concept of a grossly overweight 
 chicken is hilarious. Hence, `cushychicken`.
 
Here's some of the stuff I do and have done. 

### Technical

### Creative
I love and play steel guitar in any form, including:

* A maple dobro by Tooter Meredith, of Athens, GA. Tooter's the greatest dobro builder alive, and the nicest guy you'll ever meet. 
* An imperial Weissenborn by Ken Amant, of Weiser, ID. Extra deep body for those low notes.
* An MSA Classic D-10 pedal steel guitar. A beautiful instrument and an endless challenge.
* A Rickenbacker D-8 console steel guitar. Sounds like a Bob Wills record in a box.

I helped found Flatt Cheddar, a bluegrass band out of Bozeman, MT. I wrote and 
recorded a few songs for their first album - check it out at their [bandcamp page](http://flattcheddar.bandcamp.com).

I'm a terrible songwriter striving to be a bad songwriter. Check out some of my stuff on Soundcloud.
