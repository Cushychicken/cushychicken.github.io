This weekly linkdump is an outlet for me to catalog what's making me think, and scratches the itch I have to share it. 

I'm a little late this week. Sorry. :)

- A short, "Remain Calm" piece to all the folks freaking out about tech sector jobs. It will be hard. But it is not impossible. 

  

  If nothing else, I got a good laugh out of this comment response on HN: "_If you can’t read a hopeful, personal story without screaming “Survivorship Bias” and plunging headfirst into self-victimhood, good luck with the rest of your life!_"

- I love Esther Perel's talks. She's super articulate, and comes at her work from a variety of fascinating and nuanced perspectives. (I used to think that about Adam Grant, too, but he's dropped a few pegs in my mind.) Really like this talk on working relationships. It's a far ranging talk - trust, power, agreement/disagreement, dichotomy, complexity - it's got it all!
