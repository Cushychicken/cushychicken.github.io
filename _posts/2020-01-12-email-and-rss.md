Two updates! 

# Update One
I finally registered an email for this blog! You can now email me at cushychicken (at) gmail (dot) com. 

# Update Two
I was informed, via email, that all of the links in my RSS feed were broken - they were all pointing towards "localhost:4000" instead of "cushychicken.github.io". How embarrassing. However, this should be fixed now. (Thanks Jean Thomas for the tip!)

# A Favor
If you subscribe via RSS, could you please shoot me a quick email to convince me that the RSS feed is working correctly now?
