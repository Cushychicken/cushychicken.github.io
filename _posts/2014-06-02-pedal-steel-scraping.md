I have a love bordering on obsession with steel guitars; my latest musical endeavour is learning the pedal steel guitar. 
(If you're not familiar - here's [the great Buddy Emmons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21TI7vlOdh4) accompanying 
Ray Price on "Night Life". Buddy's the guy in the bowler hat sitting behind the table-like instrument with a bunch of strings; 
that's the pedal steel.) It's a great instrument, but supremely complicated to learn - in no large part due to the lack of teaching 
material available. That's why I was so pumped to find [Greg Cutshaw's steel guitar page](http://www.gregcutshaw.com/) - Greg's 
been kind enough to keep track of all the great steel guitar riff's he's learned over the years and put them up for free 
online. Spend a few hours combing Amazon for "C6 pedal steel instruction" and you'll see why this is such a gold mine!

For all of the great info on Greg's page, it's not in the easiest format to access. Each page has linked JPGs or PDFs
