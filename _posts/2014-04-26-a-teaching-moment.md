Nathan Borror recently put [this great post](https://medium.com/p/48edd2b40cc) on Medium detailing his reverse-engineering of the Sonos app. 
He got absolute floods of praise for his work - all of which was well 
deserved. It was a great hack, and implemented a few features that Sonos 
itself hasn't done much in the way of developing. (The Mac toolbar widget 
in particular I found quite clever - you should sell that, Nate!) 

What's garnered him the most praise, however, is the fact that he was able 
to identify (or at least act on) the complaints that most Sonos users have 
with their systems, which is is approximately the following:

> "I love Sonos, but their app is from the Stone Age!"

What about it sucks? Here are a few of the complaints I've heard (and a few 
I added myself):

* Simple and common tasks (adjusting volume, skipping tracks, play/pause) 
require a ton of interactions
* It takes a ton of button presses to make a zone grouping
* Volume management in a zone grouping isn't intuitive
* Sonos isn't smart enough to tell when the listener isn't around anymore (I *loved* that RPi geofence he implemented)
* Searching for tracks is done through the content provider rather than a 
single search interface (you can't just one search bar to check all of your subscription services)

I'll grant that two of those aren't the simplest ones to execute on - the 
RPi and search features would probably take a little time to get right. But 
user interface is something I would have expected Sonos to iterate on a lot 
more quickly. Considering we live in the era where single coders can clone 
Flappy Bird or recreate 2048 as a mobile app in a weekend, it seems like 
these changes would have come by now. These complaints on UI, after all, 
[aren't new](http://forums.sonos.com/showthread.php?t=30776). 

One guy took a pretty good crack at improving Sonos UI, singlehandedly, in a 
few short months. There is a lesson here for Sonos: the speed of iteration 
in software is going to have to improve pretty drastically to remain 
competitive. Bose, Samsung, and a zillion Kickstarter upstarts are all 
vying to fill the same hardware slot as Sonos. There might come a point 
where Sonos's lead in their hardware ecosystem doesn't mean much.
