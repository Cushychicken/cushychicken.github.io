Here's this week's development updates for bFunc, the open source function generator I'm developing to sell. Each day's entry represents an hour's work - the hour before I start work on my real job every weekday morning.

If you'd like to buy a board to try, [you can purchase one over on Gumroad](https://gum.co/bnzr)! 

[The design doc for this project](http://cushychicken.github.io/bfunc-design-doc/) is available if you're into design documents/philosophy. 

All of my hardware and software source files are on GitHub. [Check 'em out!](https://github.com/Cushychicken/bfunc)

# May 3, 2020

* Set up a Gumroad Page - [I'm officially selling bFunc](https://gum.co/bnzr), through an actual web store!
* If you'd like to buy a board, I have about 10 left. 

# May 1, 2020 

* Looking at some PGA chips
  * AD603 (expensive!!)
  * PGA113 (cheap!!)

* Could we make do with any cheaper opamps in the system? 
  * A little analysis suggests that Yes, indeed we could. 
  * There are cheaper opamps for the diff to single ended stage - they just run at lower voltages. 
  * Even adding two cheap LDOs just to step +/-12V down to +/-5V would be a huge improvement
  * TI's LMH6642 would likely be a decent candidate https://www.ti.com/product/LMH6642
  * Similar performance over same frequency range
  * Less than half the price of the AD8065 (but also half the voltage range)
* Also, since I haven't slept much and I'm a little braindead - let's test the oscillator!I 
  * Soldered up one of the Horowitz El Cheapo special probes to the oscillator output.
  * I didn't include testpoints to solder a probe on to, so I scraped back some soldermask and soldered to the trace between oscillator and DDS chip. 
  * Lots of time spent testing whether I was connected to the right trace with a scope. 
  * Long story short - during this test setup process, I found a bug! I didn't tie the oscillator ground to the board ground. How dumb. Both these oversights will definitely be fixed in the next rev. 
* Learned some cool stuff about oscillators in the meantime. 
  * For one thing: here's why you want to give your test equipment a few minutes to warm up. The frequency trend is a straight upward slope for about 5 minutes after USB power is applied. 
  * It doesn't really settle into a predictable normal distribution for a few more minutes after that. 
  * However, after about 10-15 minutes of being on, the oscillator stabilizes, and the frequency binning gets more uniform.

* Alright! Next design starts... NOW.
* I'm feeling pretty good about the firmware of my current design. 
* I'm not so comfortable with where the analog output stage is at. 
  * No buffering. 
  * No proper termination. 
  * No antialiasing. 
* Three main areas I want to focus on:
  * Output Driver + DC Offset Control
  * Differential to single end converter
  * Antialiasing filter
* Output Driver + DC Offset
  * This is a pretty straightforward inverting buffer based on AD8065 opamp
    * Unity gain stable
    * Wide bandwidth - GBP at about 150MHz
    * Rail-to-rail drive - can push/pull about 30mA
    * Not cheap - $3.71 in single quantities, $1.80 at 3k quantitiesI 
    * Originally chose very high resistance values - 20k and higher
    * Simulations showed that this would limit bandwidth pretty substantially. A quick check of the AD8065 datasheet confirms
    * Dropping resistor values to 1k made a huge difference
    * Moved 3dB freq out from ~1MHz to ~35MHz
    * Added a little feedback cap to cut down on some peaking observed around 30MHz (Input is grounded in picture below because I was simulating a prior stage)
    * Output is, as it should have been from the start - 50 ohm series terminated

* DC Offset + Output
  * Frequency response is flat +/-0.25dB out to 25MHz
  * Cursor 1 shows the point at which it starts to deviate from 0.25dB flatness area (26MHz)Cursor 2 shows the -3dB frequency (38MHz)

* DC Offset Control
  * Inspired by a few TI app notes on unipolar-to-bipolar conversion circuits
    * http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sbaa343/sbaa343.pdf?ts=1588073331377
    * http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau525/slau525.pdf
    * http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidu974/tidu974.pdf
  * This circuit followed the design steps in that first TI app note, SBAA343
  * Plug in your DAC output range, and reference voltage, and your resistor values are just plug-and-chug. 
  * AD8065 is probably *not* the right choice of opamp here - it's wildly overspecified. 
  * This stage is gonna be driven by a DAC output at pretty low frequency - 500kHz bandwidth or less. 
  * Can likely get away with a cheaper opamp - I just haven't done the work to find it yet. 
  * Cap placeholder is there for the same reason as in the output buffer - it helps cut down on a bit of the ringing/transient overshoot in fast DC step transitions

* Antialiasing Filter
  * I'd really love to have a way to capture a scope waveform of my existing system with the AD9837, and then feed that waveform into LTSpice as a simulation input. 
  * My cheapo Rigol scope doesn't have the capability to do this - or if it does, I don't know how to access it. 
  * ADI doesn't have the answer to that question, but what they *do* have is pretty cool - the [ADIsim DDS webpage](https://tools.analog.com/en/simdds/?part=AD9914&fin=3.5G&mult=1&ftw=5D9F7391&rso=111111&harmonicDB=-50&useFilters=0).
  * Allows you to select your DDS chip, your output signals, and whether or not you want an external antialiasing filter. VERY cool, and worth playing around with. 
  * Below shows the output of a DDS chip running at 23MHz output, after being filtered with a 7th order inverse Chebyshev lowpass filter.
