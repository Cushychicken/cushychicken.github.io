To start, here are two very short stories. 

**_Story One:_** I've just managed to get my ticket to [OSHWA Summit in NYC](https://2020.oshwa.org/) expensed thru work. Yes! 

**_Story Two:_** I've been feeling "the scaries" lately, largely around feelings that I haven't achieved anything significant. No! (Don't worry - I'm seeing a counselor.) 

These seem completely unconnected - definitely in the context of OSHWA. 

But then it hit me: one of the things I've always wanted to do, but never have, is design and build some little OSHW gadget. OSHWA Summit is in about six weeks. Can I make a thing in time to have HW ready for OSHWA summit? 

# The Plan 

Design, build, and bring up an OSHW device in time for OSHWA Summit in March. 

Concept at the moment: an open source function generator design. 

# Why a function generator? 
* I've been quietly obsessing over and reading about DDS chips for several months now. Actually building one should exorcise any mystical fascination I've been clinging to. 
* I've never had a function generator of my own. Scratch your own itch, right? 
* I can't, for the life of me, find an OSHW function generator design that doesn't require you to have a separate Arduino or MCU to control the thing. I don't have a problem with that per se, but I _am_ a bit impatient. Meaning: when I want to futz with hardware at home, I don't really want to put in the time to make my tools in addition to making whatever little project I have cooked up. (Yes, the irony that I've decided to take on a project that is *making tools* at a grand scale is not lost on me.)
* I don't really love the breadboard form factors of the generators I've found so far. 

# How? 
My fiance is a teacher, and as a result, I haven't slept past 630 AM since we started living together. I typically get to work around 9. With a half hour for commuting, and a half hour to get ready for work, I have an hour and a half every day to work on this. 

Same strategy as eating an elephant, really. Small bites, one at a time! 

I've already started working towards this goal, and I'm keeping a short daily journal of my progress, typically with the next day's tasks providing the jumping off point for journaling. I'm tentatively planning on publishing a weekly digest of this journal, as a way of keeping myself honest about my progress. 

Here goes nothing!

# Aside

If you have never been to OSHWA Summit - you should plan on changing that! It's *very* fun, and you get to meet a lot of smart people doing cool things in the OSHW community.
