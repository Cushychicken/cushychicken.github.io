Buddy Emmons, the greatest steel guitarist ever, passed away earlier this week. He was 78. In addition to being one of the most technically brilliant pedal steel guitarists ever to live, he also helped shape the instrument in a fashion that few other musicians can claim about their instrument. In addition to splitting up the A and B pedals to make the most classic pedal steel sounds possible on the E9th tuning, he also developed the C6th tuning and pedal layout - if the stories are correct, he did it on a dare from Shot Jackson over a weekend to prove that you _can_ play jazz on a pedal steel.

The guy had all the tone, and all the notes. Rest in peace, Buddy. There will never be another one like you.
