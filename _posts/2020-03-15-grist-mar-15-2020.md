This weekly linkdump is an outlet for me to catalog what's making me think, and scratch the itch to share it. 

- Can't say enough good things about JVN's interview with Sallie Krawcheck. Sallie is the head of Ellevest, a woman-focused investment firm. Super smart, super principled gal who's chock-full of sensible personal finance advice. It taught me a *lot* about the divide in wealth between men and women, and how it's got some deeper sociological roots than you'd expect. (Hint: it comes out in how we teach our *kids!!*)

- "folks with expensive problems have high salaries and are behind gatekeepers." - Patrick McKenzie. My favorite small business blogger nails it again.

- The best single source of information I’ve found in the new reality caused by COVID-19. If you read one thing I have ever posted, **_read this._**

- I’d have appreciated this a lot more if I still used Twitter. It did, however, teach me about the existence of [http://foller.me](http://foller.me/), which I hadn’t know existed until today. Seems like something that should have existed before now!
