This weekly linkdump is an outlet for me to catalog what's making me think, and scratches the itch I have to share it. 

- Charles Stross is one of my favorite sci-fi writers - in fact, probably my _very_ favorite. (Highly recommend the _Laundry Files_ series! And also the _Singularity_ series, though _Accelerando_ is the best of them and is good enough to stand on its own.) A great download from a guy whose job it is to paint a picture of the future. This picture is about zombies and elite panic.

  “Elite panic” is a new concept for me, but one I’m very interested in learning more about!
