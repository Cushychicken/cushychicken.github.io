I'm trying to making a habit of not waiting so long before I decide to take on a new project or hobby.

I don’t think this is a procrastination problem of mine. I think it’s a tendency to wait for perfect information before starting on something I think about. I want to be less cerebral, and more driven by action. 

I see it as only being a positive change.  

The sooner you start, the sooner compounding returns kick in. This is true for anything: learning an instrument, saving money, exercising, you name it. 

On the flip side: the sooner you start, the sooner you can realize that it's maybe not exactly what you want to be doing after all. 

Starting faster helps clarify which path you want to take, faster. 

No matter your choice - keep going, or dropping off - you're one step closer to what want than you were the day before. 

Progress, or process of elimination. Easy! (I think.)
