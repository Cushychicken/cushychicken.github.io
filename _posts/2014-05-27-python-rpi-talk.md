I gave a talk at the Boston Python Meetup Group on May 27th, 2014. And it 
rocked. You can check out the slides from that talk [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/light-and-api.pdf). 

You can also check out my project source code on my [Github profile](https://www.github.com/Cushychicken).

Project #1 (Blinking LED) is available [here]().

Project #2 (Bus Tracker) is available [here]().

Project #3 (Sonos Clock) is available [here]().

I don't have a great way to show how I wired up a lot of these, but I'd be 
happy to answer any questions on how I did via email or at one of the 
project nights.

I had a total blast giving this talk. Let's keep in touch - hit me up on
