You'd be amazed how many great thoughts you have when you just start vomiting them onto a page. 

You'd be doubly amazed if you took a little more time to rearrange those thoughts into a cohesive whole. 

Just removing the cognitive burden of keeping all those great ideas in your head is incredibly freeing. Putting them on paper (or in text) let's you focus on what's critical, and what's extraneous. 

I've found it's gotten me more organized, better informed, and less stressed.
