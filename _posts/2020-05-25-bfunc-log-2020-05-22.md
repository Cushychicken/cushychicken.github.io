**<u>This Week's Progress:</u>** Researching a bunch of components for the next rev - output opamps, filter topologies, some boost regulators, etc...

- Thereâ€™s such a thing as integrated, dual power supply modules. Whoa. 
  - CUI Inc makes this honking great dual power module: +12/-12V output at 42mA each
  - [Datasheet is here](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/cui-inc/PES1-S5-D12-M-TR/102-5767-1-ND/9838980)
  - [Footprint is here](https://www.cui.com/product/resource/pcbfootprint/pep1-s5-d12-m)

- [Possible boost converter for a +12V rail](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/diodes-incorporated/AP3012KTR-G1/AP3012KTR-G1DITR-ND/4470846)

- I had found [Craig]'s post on Hackaday [reviewing the MHS5200-A function generator](https://hackaday.com/2015/08/28/cheap-function-generator-teardown-and-improvement/) but I didn't realize he'd gone to the next level and fixed some parts of the design to make it work better. _Super_ cool!
  - Swapping out the output driver opamp for a higher slew rate model is instructive!
  - The notes on the elliptic filter redesign are also really neat!

# May 12, 2020

- Wrote some target specs for next revision - [bFunc - Rev2.0 - Specs](evernote:///view/45103333/s306/b18258c2-0c14-443b-aab6-b93d22d131ea/b18258c2-0c14-443b-aab6-b93d22d131ea/)
- Made a set of quick sims for the output stages of the next rev
  - Elliptic Filter - Step Response to 10ns rising edge
  - Elliptic Filter - Bode Plot
  - Output Driver - AD8065
- Started hardware_rev2!!
  - Starting with DDS sheet
  - Changed over to AD9834
  - Started to add in features 
  - To-Do: Double check all the decoupling capacitors 
  - To-Do: Update Crystal (need 75MHz)
