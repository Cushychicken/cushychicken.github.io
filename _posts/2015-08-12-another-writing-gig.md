I'm super pumped to announce that I've landed another writing gig. In addition to my own miscellaneous ramblings here, you can also find my work over at All About Circuits, where I've started writing as a freelance contributor. 

My first article is a little piece about executing interrupts on the Arduino platform. Would love it if you checked it out!
