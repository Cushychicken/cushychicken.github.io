I'm on this week's episode of [_The Amp Hour_ podcast](https://theamphour.com/)! 

Chris and I talk radiated emissions, sigma delta ADCs/DACs, project management, and engineering teams. I promise I don't have that short an attention span in real life. 

[Have a listen!](https://theamphour.com/474-an-interview-with-nash-reilly/)
