Most questions on Quora are posturing garbage, but I came across a pretty great one the other day: “Do you you prefer an arrogant high performer or a mediocre employee?” I don’t love the phrasing, but the underlying question is terribly important. I prefer the reframing as: “Can you overlook a low overlap in values for a high level of competence?” I'd select for values over performance in just about every case. 

A music themed hypothetical makes it a little easier to illustrate. Imagine you're in a band, and trying to choose someone you're going on tour with. It's a lot easier to make the call of who to hire when part of your consideration is "Can I live in a van with this person for weeks on end?" If the answer's "no", and you hire them anyway, you're creating two problems for yourself. First, and immediately, you're forcing yourself into a confined space with someone you can't stand. If it's not obvious at the outset that this is a problem, it will be immediately the moment you realize there is zero personal space in a Ford Econoline. [Banjoist Danny Barnes said it first](https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music), and said it best: 

*“**...**when it comes to hiring musicians, you may have to live with them at arm's length for a long time and be involved with them about emotional issues like money and life problems and stuff. you may want a person that's easy to get along with even if they are a little less sharp musically."*

Substitute just about any profession for "musicians" in the quote above, and the advice is no less sage. 

Second, you’re signing up to repeat the search for a replacement after the axe falls. Anyone who’s ever tried to do that - with musicians, engineers, managers, or really any profession that requires a modicum of skill - knows what a pain in the ass that is. The pain only gets worse with time, too. The longer you don’t make a hire, the longer it takes to get back to focusing on <insert thing you do for money here>. This issue is only exacerbated by the mountains of internal baggage that most orgs have around hiring, and hiring “the best". If you only hire the best - the grade A, top-of-the-fucking-line best - you’re only lengthening this process. Not to mention it’s a leading indicator of a whole host of other organizational rigamarole, [summarized nicely by Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-hire-the-best-just-like-everyone-else/). The baseline doesn't need to be outrageously high. Just good enough to get the job done. 

I don't think I am one of the best. More like [cranky, tenacious, and outspoken](http://blog.codinghorror.com/who-needs-talent-when-you-have-intensity/), to the point that I wake up most days not even wanting to work with myself. - _Jeff Atwood_

(Do your best to take that at face value, in spite of the fact that it’s quoting a millionaire and successful serial entrepreneur.)

On the topic of baselines - past some level of skill, there's not a high variance in performance between one person and the next. That's not to say that I haven't worked with people who are really shitty or really good at their jobs. What I'm saying is that I’ve been in the workforce for a few years, and have worked with a lot of people, and out of all of them, there are only two I'd classify as "exceptional and outstanding", and only two I'd classify as "really, really bad". The rest are not wildly different in their competence levels. They do their jobs well enough to keep everyone else making steady progress towards a common goal. And you know what? That is A-OK. I’m one of them. Chances are, you are too. 

On top of that: *baselines change*. People have this magical capability to *learn.* And that's a superpower! One that you can, quite profitably, turn to your advantage! 

The corollary of that is, if everyone has pretty similar work output, you should focus on building a really good *team.* When the whole is good, the output is consistently good. The best way to make a good team, in my mind, is to get high alignment on values. 

For me, the answer is pretty clear. “No snakes in camp”, as my dad would say. It’s all values.
