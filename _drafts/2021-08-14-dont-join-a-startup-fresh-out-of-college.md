**Hardware engineers: it's a bad idea to start your career at a startup.** I've cautioned this in private several times, to several different people, and I've decide that it's time I release this here hot take to the world. 

I'm specifically talking about your first job out of college. Jumping straight from university to a startup job is not something I'd advise. 

# You'll be Underpaid. 

Here's a fun fact that many college graduates don't appreciate: **the salary of your first job is one of the biggest determinants of your total earnings in your career**. Why? It's very, very rare for you to get paid *less* over the course of your career. Pay raises are one of the easiest ways for companies to poach talent away from other companies. This is because - well, it's kind of hard to get people to leave a stable job for *less* money than they're making now. (More on why a person might choose this in just a moment.)

Most early startups are too cash strapped to pay market rate. It's also not unusual for a startup to have little or nothing in the way of retirement support. This isn't bad in and of itself. Many people make a conscious choice to work at a startup at some point in their career. My emphasis, here, is that it is a *conscious choice*. Lots of people go to work for a startup because:

1. They want to take on responsibility in an area they aren't *quite* qualified for. 
2. They want to rapidly advance their career - either to management, or a senior technical track. 
3. They want to have an observable degree of impact in their work, and this is hard to see in a BigCo. 

I emphasize this being a conscious choice because the people making this decision later in their careers are more conscious of this choice being a *trade* rather than an absolute win. Fresh university graduates, in my experience, are not very conscious of things that you might trade by working at a startup. A few things you'll likely give up by working at a startup include:

* A market rate salary
* A retirement plan with an employer contribution and low management fees
* Healthcare options with low (or no!) deductable
* Education reimbursement 
* Options for childcare or childcare reimbursement

What's worse than making these trades, however, is the fact that most new graduates don't properly understand why these might not be optimum trades. 

I'll be blunt - taking a startup job straight after university typically means you're doing two things:

- Accepting a lower-than-market salary, which can hamstring your salary growth over the whole of your career, and
- Missing out on maximizing retirement contributions at the point in your life in which they are most valuable - i.e., early in your career, when they have the most time to grow. 

As an aside: if you have any debt from student loans, car payments, credit cards, or anything else that normal people have, it's generally a better idea to pay this debt off sooner, rather than later, to avoid paying excessive interest. (This is *especially* true for credit cards.) 

Wanna know an easy way to get rid of that debt quicker? Get paid more. You can claw your way out of the hole, build up a safety net, and start reliably building *real wealth.*

# Your Network Will Be Small

I originally wrote this as "support network", but upon reflection, there are two networks you should be caring about in your early career. The biggest is your Professional Network, which is the sum total of all people you've ever worked with, and would work with again. A subset of that is what I call the Technical Network, and I'll focus on that first, because I think it's a more pressing consideration for engineers thinking about jumping to a startup as their first job. 

## Technical Networks

I think of a "technical network" as a subset of your professional network. It's a crowd of people that nominally work on the same thing as you. They understand what problems people with your skillset are paid to solve, the hard parts of what you do, and the pitfalls you can get into if you're not careful. For example: one of my prime technical specialties is high speed digital design. My technical network are people who care about things like circuit board layout, stackup design, and signal integrity. If you happened upon us at a meetup, you'd likely find us chatting about ways of characterizing trace impedances with TDR, or complaining about signal integrity/compliance tradeoffs over beers. 

That's a great way to detect who your "tech tribe" is: what would you swap war stories about at a meetup? 

It's unlikely you'll have many peers working on the exact same thing as you in a startup. Sure, you'll probably be working on the same product, or project, but not in the same discipline. There likely won't be any senior engineers on staff who do what you do. This means you won't have anyone to bounce technical ideas off of, to check your work, or teach you about dumb mistakes that you might make. In some cases, you might be hired as a "handoff" - you're expected to take some chunk of work off another employee's plate, so that they have more time to spend on higher leverage things. (This becomes more true the smaller a company is. The first few engineering hires tend to be people that free up the founders' time to do more sales, hiring, and strategy stuff, rather than day-to-day technical implementation.)

Whatever the case, being the sole technical expert on your subject matter is hard. For one thing, it's *lonely.* Nobody you work with *really* gets what you do! On top of that, running into a problem becomes that much harder. You're on your own to solve it, with relatively little backup from other people. 

* Not knowing "the right way" to do stuff
  * You unwittingly build more bugs
  * The company unwittingly ships more bugs
  * Velocity slows as focus shifts to bugsmash rather than feature development

## Professional Networks

I cannot overemphasize how much I love Patrick McKenzie's take on most things to do with career trajectory and professional development, and I think this excerpt from ["Don't Call Yourself a Programmer"](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) nails it:

> The high-percentage outcome is you work really hard for the next couple of years, fail ingloriously, and then be jobless and looking to get into another startup.  If you really wanted to get into a startup two years out of school, you could also just go work at a megacorp for the next two years, earn a bit of money, then take your warchest, domain knowledge, and contacts and found one.
>
> Working at a startup, you tend to meet people doing startups.  Most of them will not be able to hire you in two years.  Working at a large corporation, you tend to meet other people in large corporations in your area.  Many of them either will be able to hire you or will have the ear of someone able to hire you in two years. 

(By the way - if you've never read ["Don't Call Yourself a Programmer"](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/), *scoot on over to Patrick's site and read up.* When you've finished that, I'd queue up ["Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More Valued"](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) for immediate consumption after the first.)

# Your Growth Track Will Be Poorly Defined

Promotion tracks typically don't exist in a defined way at startups. Why? Well, the highest goal of nearly every startup is *shipping.* Resources are tight at every startup. Many are pre-revenue, which means there's no money coming in from sales. These two things combine mean that almost everything will take a backseat to shipping. I've already laid out how you probably won't have anyone who can mentor you technically at a startup. If you *do* have that luxury, you will be lucky to get much of that person's time. 

- startups tend to attract people motivated by shipping product, not mentoring or growing other ICs
- Those facts in tandem mean it's really unlikely your career growth is going to get explicit attention.
- Everyone is overworked, so mentorship is hit or miss.

# You will learn *broadly*, not *deeply*

A natural tendency of BigCos is to produce technical specialists. After a while as a technical specialist in a big company, you end up being less someone who does the work, and more someone who knows what to do in a given situation regarding ( *insert specialty bit of tech in which you have expertise here*), and consults when a problem in that area arises. These types of human informational repositories are valuable to big companies, especially in areas that prove challenging for them to get right or valuable to their bottom line. Google has a material interest in hiring people who are experts in optimizing database speed. Qualcomm has a material interest in hiring the premier designers of CMOS RF circuits. 

In my experience, specialists can generalize more easily than generalists can specialize. I'd rather hire someone who's *really good* at two or three things than someone who can just get by at a dozen things. I'll paraphrase Randy Nelson from Pixar, who said this most eloquently: "The clearest indicator that you can get really good at something and produce great work, is the fact that you've already gotten really good at something else." Spending a little time at a BigCo gives you a chance to start specializing in something, and doing a lot of it every day. It's sharpening your general purpose work skills at the same time, too. 

The tradeoff of this is that you have to be a little bit careful about what you get good at. Will Larson described this well [as a trapdoor](https://lethain.com/career-advice/): if you build up a specialization in a certain thing, it can be hard to get paid working on something else. Will wrote his advice in the context of software engineers, but it's doubly true for hardware people. Big companies tend to hire you in at senior or principal roles for your *expertise* on some particular technology or hardware widget. Straying outside that specialty starts to look like a reset in compensation once you've gotten far enough down the track in your career. 

Since I'm doling out Further Reading/Watching, I highly recommend taking a few minutes to watch [Randy's talk about collaborative work at Pixar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhXJe8ANws8).

# Demographics will work against you.

I'm going to take a moment to speak about diversity, equity, and inclusion at startups. I am fully cognizant of the fact that I am a white, cisgender, straight male from a very affluent upbringing. The observations I'm including here are my attempt to map my own anecdotal experiences onto trends that other folks have written about in the industry. My intent  is to serve as an ally to groups that have been historically underserved by startup hiring. 

Nevertheless, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and I am scared shitless to comment on this. I will happily bend my ear to anyone who feels I've misrepresented the truth here - don't hesitate to email me or tweet me (@cushychicken) to set me straight.  

Several times in my career, I've observed a belief that startups give you more space to be your authentic self at work. I've heard this from folks from several historically underrepresented groups. Maybe this is correct. However, I suspect that this might be startup hiring marketing distorting reality in order to improve diversity in their hiring pipelines. For all the talk, I've never seen a small startup that had a Black employee group, or an LGBTQ pride group, or a women-in-engineering group. *Definitely* not a women in engineering group. Most startups are *terrible* at hiring women, and terrible at retaining them when they actually manage to do so. (Source: every woman I have ever personally spoken to who has worked at a startup.)

Structural factors overwhelmingly favor white, heterosexual men from affulent backgrounds to receive startup funding. These founders, through a completely understandable network effect, happen to know a bunch of other straight, white, affluent men as part of their personal and professional networks. Startup hiring hinges heavily on personal networks; getting your existing employees to hire from their networks is the cheapest and most dependable way to get competent people to work for you. You can see where this is going. People hire who they know. When who they know happens to be a pretty demographically homogenous bunch, you end up with a company that is very demographically homogenous.
