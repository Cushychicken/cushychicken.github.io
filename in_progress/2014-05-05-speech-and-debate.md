title: "Speech and Debate - A Retrospective"

I was on a speech and debate team in high school, and it was fucking *great*. 

I'm reminded of that now because one of my former teammates, Maryann, wrote this great post about 
it on her blog - you can check it out (along with the rest of her writing, which I find quite entertaining) 
[here](http://reheatedcoffee.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/darth-vader-was-my-high-school-speech-and-debate-mascot-part-i/).

I'll start by saying this is not a rebuttal. We shared a lot of similarities with a cult, or a paramilitary 
organization. That's not to say there weren't positive aspects to being a team member - I met some great 
friends, sharpened my logic and critical thinking skills, and learned the value of hard work, long hours, 
and ruthless research. I met my first two girlfriends through the team. I've never had a religious 
experience, but screeching along to the Proclaimers on a bus packed with 40 of my closest friends after 
dragging the competition through the mud comes pretty close. 

All told, however, I can't say with certainty that the net effect of my team membership was a good one. 
The time commitment by itself was pretty damn substantial - practices during the season were Monday to 
Thursday, from 4 PM to 7PM. If you didn't have a practice round, there was an expectation that you would 
stick around and research more evidence on the policy debate topic. (This mellowed out pretty substantially 
when I moved from policy debate to extemporaneous speaking my senior year of high school.) Competition 
weeks ended up being about the same time commitment as a full-time job on top of school - anywhere from 
12 to 15 hours of practice plus a 36 hour competition. 
 
 Where other teams did things like socialize 
and intermingle during meets, we isolated ourselves and studied evidence. The unofficial slogan of the team 
was "Familiarity Breeds Contempt".
