Shanghai is an awesome city to spend some time in - I've been lucky enough to have the privilege to go for 
work a few times. This is my attempt to gather a few choice bits of knowledge in one place that you might 
want to know before you go. I've also thrown in a few of the places you can go and things you can do in 
Shanghai.

## Things You Should Do

### Grab, save, and use business cards to get places.

Cabs in Shanghai are dirt cheap (the most I've ever paid is about 60 RNB - $10 USD). However, most cab 
drivers in Shanghai don't speak much English, if any. Fortunately, most businesses give out great cards 
that have their address clearly written in Chinese on them. Find a great bar or restaurant? Grab a 
card, then come back and bring friends. 

### Get a burner phone. 

Most phones these days come with SIM cards that you can use to change the network/carrier. Unfortunately, 
most modern smartphones (like the iPhone 4/5/s or the Samsung Galaxy line) use the microSIM form factor, 
while most of China is still on the plain old SIM form factor. The way that most vendors try to solve this 
is super unweildy - janky little punch tools that are supposed to trim off the excess plastic of a SIM to 
make a raggedy looking microSIM. It works great in theory, but I've never seen it pulled off in practice. 
Try to find a China Telecom store that will sell you a cheap phone for voice and text - $20 US will get you
a long way on text and voice in China.



## Places You Should Go

### Cotton's Bar

My favorite expat bar in Shanghai, and the only one I've found a decent cheeseburger at. Perfect if you're 
feeling far from home and a little overwhelmed. 

### Senator's Saloon

Cigars. Whiskey drinks. Awesome bourbon, scotch, and whiskey menu. Need I say more?

### New Heights

A great rooftop bar on the Bund - right across the river from Pearl tower. A little pricy, and the only 
place I've been service-charged in China, but the view is worth it. k
