Hi. I'm Nash Reilly. I've spent my career building consumer electronics. Most of my focus has been on designing high speed embedded systems, but I've got a reasonable amount of experience in electromagnetic compliance, embedded programming, and audio electronics. This blog is an attempt to turn some of that experience into serviceable information for people who are not my coworkers. I also run, play music, and occasionally whip up a website.  

I'd love to hear from you in any capacity - technology wise, career wise, or just to shoot the breeze. I'd recommend one of the two methods below:

* **Email:** cushychicken (at) Google's mail dot com. 
* **Reddit:** [/u/LightWolfCavalry](https://www.reddit.com/user/LightWolfCavalry). 

I will take a look at any single page electronic schematic that you'd like reviewed. I won't help you with your homework, or to make a deadline, but I'd like to see what you're building, and offer constructive feedback if I can. Reddit is also the best way to make contact with me for that purpose.

I'm hosting this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog on Github Pages, and using the [Voyager](https://github.com/redVi/voyager) theme.
